# W03-Calculations-Solution2

This is another solution to calculations.

This one uses higher order functions to determine the operation to perform. It also uses a lambda to handle the radio button clicks -- I do prefer this to the stand alone function.

Thanks to Phillip and Hollie for the suggestions!
